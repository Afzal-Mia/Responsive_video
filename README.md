# Responsive_video
This webpage combines HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create a visually appealing and interactive user interface:
HTML Structure:

Sets up the basic webpage structure with a header (<header>) containing a navigation bar and a main content section (<main>) for the background video.
Uses a <video> element with properties for autoplay, muted sound, and looping to create a seamless background video experience.
Includes an <overlay> element positioned on top of the video to display text content like your name and a contact button.
Links to external CSS (style.css) for styling and an empty Javascript file (index.js) for the implemented functionality.
CSS Styling:

Imports a font from Google Fonts for a polished look.
Defines a consistent baseline style for all elements using the * selector (margins, padding, box-sizing, and font family).
Styles the header section with a background color.
Creates a responsive navigation bar that adapts its layout and link styles for different screen sizes (ensuring a good user experience on various devices).
Positions the background video and handles aspect ratio issues to maintain a good fit within the layout.
Styles the text overlay on top of the video for readability.
Javascript Functionality:

Introduces interactivity by showing/hiding the navigation list when the toggle menu button is clicked.
Cleverly changes the icon in the toggle button from a hamburger menu to a cross icon depending on whether the navigation list is open or closed, enhancing user experience.
